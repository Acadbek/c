NNAAMMEE
       nanorc - GNU nano's configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _n_a_n_o_r_c  files  contain  the  default settings for nnaannoo, a small and friendly editor.  During startup, if ----rrccffiillee is not
       given, nnaannoo will read two files: first the system-wide settings, from _/_e_t_c_/_n_a_n_o_r_c (the exact path might be different on  your
       system),  and  then  the  user-specific  settings, either from _~_/_._n_a_n_o_r_c or from _$_X_D_G___C_O_N_F_I_G___H_O_M_E_/_n_a_n_o_/_n_a_n_o_r_c or from _~_/_._c_o_n_‐
       _f_i_g_/_n_a_n_o_/_n_a_n_o_r_c, whichever is encountered first.  If ----rrccffiillee is given, nnaannoo will read just the specified settings file.

NNOOTTIICCEE
       Since version 4.0, nnaannoo by default:

           • does not automatically hard-wrap lines that become overlong,
           • includes the line below the title bar in the editing area,
           • does linewise (smooth) scrolling.

       To get the old, Pico behavior back, you can use sseett bbrreeaakklloonngglliinneess, sseett eemmppttyylliinnee, and sseett jjuummppyyssccrroolllliinngg.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The configuration file accepts a series of sseett and uunnsseett commands, which can be used to configure nano on startup without us‐
       ing  command-line options.  Additionally, there are some commands to define syntax highlighting and to rebind keys -- see the
       two separate sections on those.  nnaannoo reads one command per line.  All commands and keywords should be written in lowercase.

       Options in _n_a_n_o_r_c files take precedence over nano's defaults, and command-line options override _n_a_n_o_r_c settings.   Also,  op‐
       tions  that do not take an argument are unset by default.  So using the uunnsseett command is only needed when wanting to override
       a setting of the system's _n_a_n_o_r_c file in your own _n_a_n_o_r_c.  Options that take an argument cannot be unset.

       Quotes inside the _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s  parameters below should not be escaped.  The last double quote on the line will be seen as  the
       closing quote.

       The supported commands and arguments are:

       sseett aafftteerreennddss
          Make Ctrl+Right and Ctrl+Delete stop at word ends instead of beginnings.

       sseett aallllooww__iinnsseeccuurree__bbaacckkuupp
          When  backing  up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its permissions can't be (re)set due to special OS considera‐
          tions.  You should NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.

       sseett aattbbllaannkkss
          When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blank characters (tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge
          of the screen.

       sseett aauuttooiinnddeenntt
          Automatically  indent  a  newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or spaces as the previous line (or as the next
          line if the previous line is the beginning of a paragraph).

       sseett bbaacckkuupp
          When saving a file, create a backup file by adding a tilde (~~) to the file's name.

       sseett bbaacckkuuppddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved -- when back‐
          ups are enabled with sseett bbaacckkuupp or ----bbaacckkuupp or --BB.  The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

       sseett bboollddtteexxtt
          Use  bold  instead  of  reverse video for the title bar, status bar, key combos, function tags, line numbers, and selected
          text.  This can be overridden by setting the options ttiittlleeccoolloorr, ssttaattuussccoolloorr, kkeeyyccoolloorr,  ffuunnccttiioonnccoolloorr,  nnuummbbeerrccoolloorr,  and
          sseelleecctteeddccoolloorr.

       sseett bbooookkssttyyllee
          When justifying, treat any line that starts with whitespace as the beginning of a paragraph (unless auto-indenting is on).

       sseett bbrraacckkeettss ""_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s""
          Set  the  characters treated as closing brackets when justifying paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only
          closing punctuation (see sseett ppuunncctt), optionally followed by the specified closing brackets, can end  sentences.   The  de‐
          fault value is """''))>>]]}}".

       sseett bbrreeaakklloonngglliinneess
          Automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong.

       sseett ccaasseesseennssiittiivvee
          Do case-sensitive searches by default.

       sseett ccoonnssttaannttsshhooww
          Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.  This overrides the option qquuiicckkbbllaannkk.

       sseett ccuuttffrroommccuurrssoorr
          Use cut-from-cursor-to-end-of-line by default, instead of cutting the whole line.

       sseett eemmppttyylliinnee
          Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.

       sseett eerrrroorrccoolloorr [bboolldd,,][iittaalliicc,,]_f_g_c_o_l_o_r,,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r
          Use  this  color  combination for the status bar when an error message is displayed.  The default value is bboolldd,,wwhhiittee,,rreedd.
          See sseett ttiittlleeccoolloorr for valid color names.

       sseett ffiillll _n_u_m_b_e_r
          Set the target width for justifying and automatic hard-wrapping at this _n_u_m_b_e_r of columns.  If the value  is  0  or  less,
          wrapping  will occur at the width of the screen minus _n_u_m_b_e_r columns, allowing the wrap point to vary along with the width
          of the screen if the screen is resized.  The default value is --88.

       sseett ffuunnccttiioonnccoolloorr [bboolldd,,][iittaalliicc,,]_f_g_c_o_l_o_r,,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r
          Use this color combination for the concise function descriptions in the two help lines at the bottom of the  screen.   See
          sseett ttiittlleeccoolloorr for more details.

       sseett gguuiiddeessttrriippee _n_u_m_b_e_r
          Draw  a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the width of the text.  (The color of the stripe can be changed
          with sseett ssttrriippeeccoolloorr.)

       sseett hhiissttoorryylloogg
          Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and executed commands, so they can be easily reused in  later
          sessions.

       sseett iinnddiiccaattoorr
          Display  a  "scrollbar" on the righthand side of the edit window.  It shows the position of the viewport in the buffer and
          how much of the buffer is covered by the viewport.

       sseett jjuummppyyssccrroolllliinngg
          Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.

       sseett kkeeyyccoolloorr [bboolldd,,][iittaalliicc,,]_f_g_c_o_l_o_r,,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r
          Use this color combination for the shortcut key combos in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.  See sseett  ttiittllee‐‐
          ccoolloorr for more details.

       sseett lliinneennuummbbeerrss
          Display line numbers to the left of the text area.  (Any line with an anchor additionally gets a mark in the margin.)

       sseett lloocckkiinngg
          Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.

       sseett mmaaggiicc
          When  neither  the  file's  name  nor  its  first line give a clue, try using libmagic to determine the applicable syntax.
          (Calling libmagic can be relatively time consuming.  It is therefore not done by default.)

       sseett mmaattcchhbbrraacckkeettss ""_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s""
          Specify the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket searches.  This may not  include  blank  characters.
          The  opening  set  must  come  before  the  closing set, and the two sets must be in the same order.  The default value is
          "((<<[[{{))>>]]}}".

       sseett mmiinniibbaarr
          Suppress the title bar and instead show information about the current buffer at the bottom of the screen, in the space for
          the status bar.  In this "minibar" the filename is shown on the left, followed by an asterisk if the buffer has been modi‐
          fied.  On the right are displayed the current line and column number, the code of the character under the cursor (in  Uni‐
          code format: U+xxxx), the same flags as are shown by sseett ssttaatteeffllaaggss, and a percentage that expresses how far the cursor is
          into the file (linewise).  When a file is loaded or saved, and also when switching between buffers, the number of lines in
          the  buffer  is  displayed  after the filename.  This number is cleared upon the next keystroke, or replaced with an [i/n]
          counter when multiple buffers are open.  The line plus column numbers and the character code are displayed only  when  sseett
          ccoonnssttaannttsshhooww  is  used, and can be toggled on and off with MM--CC.  The state flags are displayed only when sseett ssttaatteeffllaaggss is
          used.

       sseett mmiinniiccoolloorr [bboolldd,,][iittaalliicc,,]_f_g_c_o_l_o_r,,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r
          Use this color combination for the minibar.  (When this option is not specified, the colors of the title  bar  are  used.)
          See sseett ttiittlleeccoolloorr for more details.

       sseett mmoouussee
          Enable  mouse  support, if available for your system.  When enabled, mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the
          mark (with a double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X Window System, and on  the  console  when
          gpm is running.  Text can still be selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.

       sseett mmuullttiibbuuffffeerr
          When reading in a file with ^^RR, insert it into a new buffer by default.

       sseett nnooccoonnvveerrtt
          Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.

       sseett nnoohheellpp
          Don't display the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.

       sseett nnoonneewwlliinneess
          Don't automatically add a newline when a text does not end with one.  (This can cause you to save non-POSIX text files.)

       sseett nnoowwrraapp
          Deprecated option since it has become the default setting.  When needed, use uunnsseett bbrreeaakklloonngglliinneess instead.

       sseett nnuummbbeerrccoolloorr [bboolldd,,][iittaalliicc,,]_f_g_c_o_l_o_r,,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r
          Use this color combination for line numbers.  See sseett ttiittlleeccoolloorr for more details.

       sseett ooppeerraattiinnggddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          nnaannoo  will  only  read and write files inside _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory is changed to
          here, so files are inserted from this directory.  By default, the operating directory feature is turned off.

       sseett ppoossiittiioonnlloogg
          Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions.  The cursor position is remembered for the  200  most-recently
          edited files.

       sseett pprreesseerrvvee
          Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^^QQ and ^^SS).

       sseett pprroommppttccoolloorr [bboolldd,,][iittaalliicc,,]_f_g_c_o_l_o_r,,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r
          Use this color combination for the prompt bar.  (When this option is not specified, the colors of the title bar are used.)
          See sseett ttiittlleeccoolloorr for more details.

       sseett ppuunncctt ""_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s""
          Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying paragraphs.  This  may  not  include  blank  characters.
          Only  the  specfified closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets (see bbrraacckkeettss), can end sentences.  The
          default value is "!!..??".

       sseett qquuiicckkbbllaannkk
          Make status-bar messages disappear after 1 keystroke instead of after 20.  Note that option ccoonnssttaannttsshhooww  overrides  this.
          When  option mmiinniibbaarr or zzeerroo is in effect, qquuiicckkbbllaannkk makes a message disappear after 0.8 seconds instead of after the de‐
          fault 1.5 seconds.

       sseett qquuootteessttrr ""_r_e_g_e_x""
          Set the regular expression for matching the quoting part of a line.  The  default  value  is  "^^(([[ \\tt]]**(([[!!##%%::;;>>||}}]]||////))))++".
          (Note that \\tt stands for an actual Tab character.)  This makes it possible to rejustify blocks of quoted text when compos‐
          ing email, and to rewrap blocks of line comments when writing source code.

       sseett rraawwsseeqquueenncceess
          Interpret escape sequences directly, instead of asking nnccuurrsseess to translate them.  (If you need this option  to  get  some
          keys to work properly, it means that the terminfo terminal description that is used does not fully match the actual behav‐
          ior of your terminal.  This can happen when you ssh into a BSD machine, for example.)  Using this option  disables  nnaannoo's
          mouse support.

       sseett rreebbiinnddddeelleettee
          Interpret  the Delete and Backspace keys differently so that both Backspace and Delete work properly.  You should only use
          this option when on your system either Backspace acts like Delete or Delete acts like Backspace.

       sseett rreeggeexxpp
          Do regular-expression searches by default.  Regular expressions in nnaannoo are of the extended type (ERE).

       sseett ssaavveeoonneexxiitt
          Save a changed buffer automatically on exit (^^XX); don't prompt.  (The old form of this option,  sseett  tteemmppffiillee,  is  depre‐
          cated.)

       sseett ssccrroolllleerrccoolloorr _f_g_c_o_l_o_r,,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r
          Use  this  color combination for the indicator alias "scrollbar".  (On terminal emulators that link to a libvte older than
          version 0.55, using a background color here does not work correctly.)  See sseett ttiittlleeccoolloorr for more details.

          Use this color combination for selected text.  See sseett ttiittlleeccoolloorr for more details.

       sseett sshhoowwccuurrssoorr
          Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, and show the cursor in the help viewer, to aid  braille  users
          and people with poor vision.

       sseett ssmmaarrtthhoommee
          Make  the  Home  key  smarter.   When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a
          line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the cursor is already at  that  position,
          it will jump to the true beginning of the line.

       sseett ssooffttwwrraapp
          Display lines that exceed the screen's width over multiple screen lines.  (You can make this soft-wrapping occur at white‐
          space instead of rudely at the screen's edge, by using also sseett aattbbllaannkkss.)

          Use the given _p_r_o_g_r_a_m to do spell checking and correcting, instead of using the built-in corrector that calls  hhuunnssppeellll(1)

          This tells nnaannoo to select from the available palette the color that approximates the given values.

          Either "_f_g_c_o_l_o_r" or ",,_b_g_c_o_l_o_r" may be left out, and the pair may be preceded by bboolldd and/or iittaalliicc (separated  by  commas)

SSYYNNTTAAXX HHIIGGHHLLIIGGHHTTIINNGG
       Coloring  the  different syntactic elements of a file is done via regular expressions (see the ccoolloorr command below).  This is
       inherently imperfect, because regular expressions are not powerful enough to fully parse a file.  Nevertheless,  regular  ex‐
       pressions can do a lot and are easy to make, so they are a good fit for a small editor like nnaannoo.

       All  regular expressions in nnaannoo are POSIX extended regular expressions.  This means that .., ??, **, ++, ^^, $$, and several other
       characters are special.  The period .. matches any single character, ?? means the preceding item is optional, ** means the  pre‐
       ceding  item  may  be matched zero or more times, ++ means the preceding item must be matched one or more times, ^^ matches the
       beginning of a line, and $$ the end, \\<< matches the start of a word, and \\>> the end, and \\ss matches a blank.   It  also  means
       that  lookahead  and  lookbehind  are  not possible.  A complete explanation can be found in the manual page of GNU grep: mmaann
       ggrreepp.

       For each kind of file a separate syntax can be defined via the following commands:

       ssyynnttaaxx _n_a_m_e [""_f_i_l_e_r_e_g_e_x"" ...]
              Start the definition of a syntax with this _n_a_m_e.  All subsequent ccoolloorr and other such commands will be added  to  this
              syntax, until a new ssyynnttaaxx command is encountered.

              When nnaannoo is run, this syntax will be automatically activated if the current filename matches the extended regular ex‐
              pression _f_i_l_e_r_e_g_e_x.  Or the syntax can be explicitly activated by using the --YY or ----ssyynnttaaxx  command-line  option  fol‐
              lowed by the _n_a_m_e.

              The syntax ddeeffaauulltt is special: it takes no _f_i_l_e_r_e_g_e_x, and applies to files that don't match any syntax's regexes.  The
              syntax nnoonnee is reserved; specifying it on the command line is the same as not having a syntax at all.

       hheeaaddeerr ""_r_e_g_e_x"" ...
              If from all defined syntaxes no _f_i_l_e_r_e_g_e_x matched, then compare this _r_e_g_e_x (or regexes) against the first line of  the
              current file, to determine whether this syntax should be used for it.

       mmaaggiicc ""_r_e_g_e_x"" ...
              If no _f_i_l_e_r_e_g_e_x matched and no hheeaaddeerr regex matched either, then compare this _r_e_g_e_x (or regexes) against the result of
              querying the mmaaggiicc database about the current file, to determine whether this syntax should be  used  for  it.   (This
              functionality only works when lliibbmmaaggiicc is installed on the system and will be silently ignored otherwise.)

       ffoorrmmaatttteerr _p_r_o_g_r_a_m [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...]
              Run  the  given _p_r_o_g_r_a_m on the full contents of the current buffer.  (The current buffer is written out to a temporary
              file, the program is run on it, and then the temporary file is read back in, replacing the contents of the buffer.)

       lliinntteerr _p_r_o_g_r_a_m [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ...]
              Use the given _p_r_o_g_r_a_m to run a syntax check on the current buffer.

       ccoommmmeenntt ""_s_t_r_i_n_g""
              Use the given _s_t_r_i_n_g for commenting and uncommenting lines.  If the string contains a vertical bar or  pipe  character
              (||),  this  designates bracket-style comments; for example, "//**||**//" for CSS files.  The characters before the pipe are
              prepended to the line and the characters after the pipe are appended at the end of the line.  If no pipe character  is
              present,  the  full string is prepended; for example, "##" for Python files.  If empty double quotes are specified, the
              comment/uncomment function is disabled; for example, "" for JSON.  The default value is "##".

       ttaabbggiivveess ""_s_t_r_i_n_g""
              Make the <Tab> key produce the given _s_t_r_i_n_g.  Useful for languages like Python that want to see only spaces for inden‐
              tation.  This overrides the setting of the ttaabbssttoossppaacceess option.

              Paint  all  pieces  of  text that match the extended regular expression _r_e_g_e_x with the given foreground and background
              colors, at least one of which must be specified.  Valid color names are: rreedd,  ggrreeeenn,  bblluuee,  mmaaggeennttaa,  yyeellllooww,  ccyyaann,
              wwhhiittee,  and  bbllaacckk.   Each  of these eight names may be prefixed with the word lliigghhtt to get a brighter version of that
              color.  The word ggrreeyy or ggrraayy may be used as a synonym for lliigghhttbbllaacckk.  On terminal emulators that can do at least 256

              means the default foreground or background color.  On such emulators, the color may also be specified as a three-digit
              hexadecimal number prefixed with ##, with the digits representing the amounts of red, green,  and  blue,  respectively.
              This tells nnaannoo to select from the available palette the color that approximates the given values.

              The  color pair may be preceded by bboolldd and/or iittaalliicc (separated by commas) to get a bold and/or slanting typeface, if
              your terminal can do those.

              All coloring commands are applied in the order in which they are specified, which means that later  commands  can  re‐
              color stuff that was colored earlier.

       Key bindings can be changed via the following three commands:

          bbiinndd _k_e_y _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n _m_e_n_u
                 Rebinds  the  given _k_e_y to the given _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n in the given _m_e_n_u (or in all menus where the function exists when aallll
                 is used).

          bbiinndd _k_e_y ""_s_t_r_i_n_g"" _m_e_n_u
                 Makes the given _k_e_y produce the given _s_t_r_i_n_g in the given _m_e_n_u (or in all menus where the key exists  when  aallll  is
                 used).   The _s_t_r_i_n_g can consist of text or commands or a mix of them.  (To enter a command into the _s_t_r_i_n_g, precede
                 its keystroke with MM--VV.)

          uunnbbiinndd _k_e_y _m_e_n_u
                 Unbinds the given _k_e_y from the given _m_e_n_u (or from all menus where the key exists when aallll is used).

       The format of _k_e_y should be one of:

          ^^_X     where _X is a Latin letter, or one of several ASCII characters (@, ], \, ^, _), or the word "Space".  Example: ^C.

          MM--_X    where _X is any ASCII character except [, or the word "Space".  Example: M-8.

          SShh--MM--_X where _X is a Latin letter.  Example: Sh-M-U.  By default, each Meta+letter keystroke does the same  as  the  corre‐
                 sponding  Shift+Meta+letter.   But  when any Shift+Meta bind is made, that will no longer be the case, for all let‐
                 ters.

          FF_N     where _N is a numeric value from 1 to 24.  Example: F10.  (Often, FF1133 to FF2244 can be typed as FF11 to FF1122 with Shift.)

          IInnss or DDeell.

       Rebinding ^^MM (Enter) or ^^II (Tab) is probably not a good idea.  Rebinding ^^[[ (Esc) is not possible, because its keycode is the
       starter  byte  of Meta keystrokes and escape sequences.  Rebinding any of the dedicated cursor-moving keys (the arrows, Home,
       End, PageUp and PageDown) is not possible.  On some terminals it's not possible to rebind ^^HH (unless ----rraaww is  used)  because
       its keycode is identical to that of the Backspace key.

       Valid _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n names to be bound are:

          hheellpp

            set.

          wwhheerreeiiss

          cchhooppwwoorrddlleefftt
            Deletes from the cursor position to the beginning of the  preceding  word.   (This  function  is  bound  by  default  to
            <Shift+Ctrl+Delete>.   If  your terminal produces ^^HH for <Ctrl+Backspace>, you can make <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word
            to the left of the cursor by rebinding ^^HH to this function.)

          jjuussttiiffyy
            Justifies  the  current  paragraph  (or the marked region).  A paragraph is a group of contiguous lines that, apart from
            possibly the first line, all have the same indentation.  The beginning of a paragraph is detected by  either  this  lone
            line with a differing indentation or by a preceding blank line.

          ffuulllljjuussttiiffyy

          ssccrroolllluupp
            Scrolls  the viewport up one row (meaning that the text slides down) while keeping the cursor in the same text position,
            if possible.  (This function is bound by default to <Alt+Up>.  If <Alt+Up> does nothing on your Linux console,  see  the
